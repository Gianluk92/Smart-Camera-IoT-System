# Smart-Camera-IoT-System
This project is developed using Cooja and oneM2M. To obtain a ready to use system to test this project use contiki.
With contiki is possible starts oneM2M (use the setting file in oneM2M to obtain the right interconnection through IN and MN). When oneM2M is readies open cooja simulation tool (this tool permit to simulate a network of sensor that are interconnected via IEEE 802.15.4 using RPL).
The project is divided in two main parts, the first is IN folder where its AE (Application Entity) describe the use of the IN inside the project.
The same thing is for the MN, where the information from cooja sensor are token and processed before insert it inside oneM2M.
