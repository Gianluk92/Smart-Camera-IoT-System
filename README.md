# Smart-Camera-IoT-System
This project is developed using Cooja and oneM2M. For obtain a ready to use system for test this project use contiki.
With contiki is possible start oneM2M (use the setting file in oneM2M for obtain the right interconnection through IN and MN). When oneM2M is ready
open cooja simultion tool (this tool permit to simulate a network of sensor that are interconnected via IEEE 802.15.4 using RPL).
The project is divided in two main part, the first is IN folder where its AE (Application Entity) describe the use of the IN inside the project.
The same thing is for the MN, where the information from cooja sensor are token and processed before insert it inside oneM2M.
